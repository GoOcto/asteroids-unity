# asteroids-unity

A console-like game that mimics Atari Asterois in many respects (including some sound-fx) with a more modern 3D look to the interface.
Can be compiled for native platforms or WebGL.

               Big Ass Rocks  -  10 pts
               Regular Rocks  -  20 pts
               Smithereens    -  50 pts
               Largish Saucer - 200 pts
                  L'il Saucer - 500 pts

     Finish in less than 3:00 - 10 pts/sec

Pilot's Notes:
   Don't blow all rocks to smithereens too soon, they
will be hard to avoid. Li'l saucers are most annoying.
An asteroid field is a really bad place to hyperjump.
